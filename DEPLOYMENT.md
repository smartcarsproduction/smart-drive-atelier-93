# Smart Cars Elite - Render Deployment Guide

## Quick Deploy to Render

### 1. Prerequisites
- GitHub repository with your code
- Render account (render.com)

### 2. Database Setup
1. In Render Dashboard, click "New +" â†’ "PostgreSQL"
2. Name: `smartcars-db`
3. Plan: Choose your preferred plan
4. Region: Choose closest to your users
5. Click "Create Database"
6. **Copy the Internal Database URL** from the database info page

### 3. Web Service Setup
1. In Render Dashboard, click "New +" â†’ "Web Service"
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Configure the service:

**Basic Settings:**
- Name: `smartcars-elite`
- Environment: `Node`
- Region: Same as your database
- Branch: `main` (or your default branch)

**Build & Deploy:**
- Build Command: `bun install && bun run build`
- Start Command: `bun run start`

**Environment Variables:**
```
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=[Your Internal Database URL from step 2]
JWT_SECRET=[Generate a secure random string]
FRONTEND_URL=[Your render app URL, e.g., https://smartcars-elite.onrender.com]
```

### 4. Important Configuration

**Auto-Deploy:** 
- Enable auto-deploy from your main branch for continuous deployment

**Health Check:**
- Render will automatically check `/api/health` endpoint

### 5. Production Features Configured

âœ… **Full-Stack Architecture**: Single service serves both API and React app  
âœ… **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM  
âœ… **Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh mechanism  
âœ… **Admin Dashboard**: All admin features with proper feedback  
âœ… **Google OAuth**: Production-ready authentication  
âœ… **API Endpoints**: All CRUD operations for vehicles, bookings, services  
âœ… **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured for production  
âœ… **Static File Serving**: React app served by Express in production  
âœ… **Environment Variables**: Production-safe configuration  

### 6. Post-Deployment Testing

Once deployed, test these key features:

**Authentication:**
- [x] User registration and login
- [x] Google OAuth login  
- [x] Admin dashboard access (smartcars.production@gmail.com)
- [x] JWT token refresh

**Core Features:**
- [x] Vehicle management
- [x] Service booking
- [x] Dashboard functionality
- [x] Admin operations
- [x] All API endpoints responding

**Production Readiness:**
- [x] Database migrations applied
- [x] Static assets loading correctly
- [x] API endpoints working via HTTPS
- [x] Admin buttons providing feedback
- [x] Error handling in place

### 7. Security Notes

**Authentication Storage:**
- Access tokens: Stored in localStorage (short-lived)
- Refresh tokens: Currently in localStorage (consider HttpOnly cookies for enhanced security)
- JWT secrets: Use environment variables, never commit to code

### 8. Troubleshooting

**If deployment fails:**
1. Check build logs in Render dashboard
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure database URL is the internal URL
4. Check that TypeScript compilation succeeded
5. Verify database migrations applied successfully

**If app doesn't load:**
1. Check runtime logs for errors
2. Verify frontend assets are being served from /dist
3. Check CORS configuration matches FRONTEND_URL
4. Ensure database connection is working
5. Test health endpoint: `/api/health`

**API Issues:**
- Check `/api/health` endpoint first
- Verify database migrations ran successfully  
- Check authentication endpoints
- Test CRUD operations
- Verify JWT_SECRET is properly set

### 8. Environment Variables Reference

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret-min-32-chars
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-app.onrender.com
```
